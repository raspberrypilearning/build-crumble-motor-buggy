## Make your buggy

--- task ---

The first step is to find, or make, the chassis that will be the base for your gear motors and hold the electronics.

If your chassis is not very strong, or if it is too flexible, then you could stick a piece of strong cardboard where the motors are going to be attached to keep everything steady.

Next, you will fix the motors in place. A glue gun is ideal for this, but you could also use double-sided sticky tape.

Place the first motor on the chassis. Make sure that the motor sticks out enough to put the wheels on without them rubbing (particularly if you are using a chassis with angled sides, such as a margarine tub). If you are not sure how far the motor needs to stick out, you could attach the wheel to the motor first, then fix the motor in place. 

The wires, or terminals, of the motors need to be facing inwards. If they face outwards, they will get tangled with the wheels.

Try to get the two motors lined up together so that they are the same distance from the back, or front, and parallel.

Put the wheels onto the motors. The wheels are usually quite a tight fit but should just push onto the plastic spigot coming out of the side of the gear motor.

Whatever you are using for your roller ball, check how level the buggy is going to be when you attach it to the chassis. Roller balls work best when they are roughly level, so if your roller ball is much smaller than your wheels, put in some cardboard spacers to raise it.

The deodorant roller ball in this example buggy is quite level, but since the box is quite flimsy, it is a good idea to put a cardboard base down first.

Fix your roller ball onto the supporting base, or directly onto the chassis.

Now that the functional build is done, if you like, you can add the rest of your design and turn your motor buggy into something wonderful!
