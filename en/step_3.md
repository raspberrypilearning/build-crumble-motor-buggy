## Making your buggy

--- task ---

The first step is to find, or make, your chassis that will be the base for your gear motors and hold the electronics.

If your chassis is not very strong or is quite flexible, it is worth sticking a bit of stronger board where the motors are going to be attached to keep everything steady. 

<b>Note:</b> this partly depends on whether you are making something you want to last or just a really quick prototype.
