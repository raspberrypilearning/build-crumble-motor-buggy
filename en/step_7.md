## Challenge: There and back again

Code your Crumble motor robot buggy to start off in a set place, go forward about 30cm turn around and come back to the starting position.

Sounds easy but getting the right timing and speed to turn around 180° might be trickier that you think. You might also find that your buggy does not drive quite as straight as you would like.

Note: The amount of time needed to travel 30cm and to turn 180° might increase as the charge in your batteries gets lower.

Try and write code so that when the `program starts`{:class="crumblebasic"}, `wait a couple of seconds`{:class="crumblecontrol"} and then `turn both motors forwards`{:class="crumbleinputoutput"}, `wait`{:class="crumblecontrol"} until the buggy has travelled about 30cm, then start the `motors turning right`{:class="crumbleinputoutput"} `until`{:class="crumblecontrol"} they have turned 180° (a half turn) then `turn both motors forwards`{:class="crumbleinputoutput"} `until`{:class="crumblecontrol"} the buggy is back in its starting position and `stop both motors`{:class="crumbleinputoutput"}.

You will need to use the blocks below to create the 'there and back again' code.

Can you rearrange them and alter the wait times to make the code work?

The code below is correct for the example buggy. Your wait times and speeds might need altering for your specific buggy.
