## Wiring up your Crumble buggy

First of all, let's just have a look at some different motors and connectors.

In the Getting started with Crumble project we looked at connecting DC motors but the example used an ordinary DC mini motor of the kind that are found in many schools. These generally have very high speeds but low torque which means a buggy might run very fast but the motors would find it really hard to get moving at all from a stopped position. This is not much use for this project.

Gear motors come in many shapes and sizes but commonly you'll find very affordable (yes, I mean cheap as chips) yellow plastic ones that simply hold a standard DC mini motor.

Many of these inexpensive gear motors come, like most mini motors, with bare positive and negative terminals like the ones in the image below. It can be tricky to keep crocodile clips on these as the buggy moves and they often break off making the motor quite useless.

Some gear motors, such as those found in the CamJam EduKit 3 Robotics Kit, have wires already soldered on and shrink-tubed in place. These are much easier to connect and much more robust. These are the motors that you will see in this example build.

The best version of all for the Crumble are the gear motors sold by the makers of Crumble, [Redfern Electronics](https://redfernelectronics.co.uk/product/pair-of-geared-motors/){:target="_blank"}, who make gear motors will crocodile leads already attached. This makes the motors not only easy to connect but also make the wiring much easier to understand.
