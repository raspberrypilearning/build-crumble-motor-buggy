## What does a motor buggy look like?

Well, what does a motor buggy look like? The question should really be, what do you want your robot motor buggy to look like?

You can make your motor buggy out of anything that you have to hand, or can get hold of! You can make the motor chassis (the main body) yourself or you can reuse a box or container. 

Once you have your chassis and you've added wheels, you could leave it like that or add funky decorations and styling to it. It really is all up to you.

There are just a few things that you need to include:

+ The main body (chassis) of the buggy with space for the Crumble and battery box
+ Two DC motors that can be fixed to the chassis
+ One front roller-ball wheel (or something smooth that will slide)

The rest is up to you!
