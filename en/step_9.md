## Random journey 2

Random journey 1 was a repeat loop with three basic steps:
+ move a random distance
+ turn right a random rotation
+ turn left a random rotation

It would make more sense to simply turn either left or right by a random amount but randomising whether you turn left or right is a little more complicated, so that's what we are going to do next!

We'll start with the code that we ended with for 'random journey 1'.

If you don't already have it, open it now,and if you didn't save it, then make it now.

Let's just recap what each part of the code does before we start taking some parts out.

--- task ---

Pick a `random 0 to 10`{:class="crumbleoperators"} block from the `Operators`{:class="crumbleoperators"} palette.

Place it in the speed section of the first `motor`{:class="crumbleinputoutput"} block and set the number range from `50`{:class="crumbleoperators"} to `80`{:class="crumbleoperators"}.
